Credit Card Form : 
Overview :
This project is a dynamic and interactive credit card form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Credit Card Form is designed to provide users with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for entering their credit card details. It features real-time updates on a card preview, interactive animations, input validation, and formatting to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience. 

Features :
Responsive Design: The form is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
Interactive Card Preview: As users input their card details, the card preview updates in real-time, reflecting the entered data.
Card Flip Animation: When users focus on the CVV input field, the card flips to show the back side, simulating the real-world experience of entering the CVV.
Input Masking and Formatting: The form automatically formats the credit card number into groups of four digits and validates the CVV and expiration date inputs.
Real-Time Validation: Basic validation is implemented to provide instant feedback on the inputs, ensuring that users enter the correct format.

Required Attribute:

Added required to each input field to ensure that the form cannot be submitted without filling in all the fields.
Example: <input type="text" id="card-number" placeholder="1234 1234 1234 1234" maxlength="19" required />
Form Action and Method:

Added action="/process_payment" and method="POST" to the form element.
This specifies that the form data will be sent to the /process_payment endpoint using the POST method when the form is submitted.
These modifications ensure that users must fill in all required fields before submitting the form, and the form will be processed through the specified action and method.

Card Number Formatting:

Updated cardNumberInput to format as four groups of four digits.
Validates that the card number is 16 digits long.
Card Back Issue:

Fixed the issue of the card not flipping by ensuring CVV is correctly displayed on the back of the card.
Input Validation:

Added validation for card number, card holder name, and expiry date.
Alerts users to enter valid values if they do not match the required formats.
OTP Functionality:

Set the OTP to a fixed six-digit number "123456".
Added validation for OTP input during form submission.
Landing Page:

Added a home button to return to the main form.
Resets the form and hides the landing page when the home button is clicked.
