## Project Overview
The Full Stack Developer Portfolio is a responsive website that highlights the developer's expertise in front-end and back-end development, UI/UX design, and more. It serves as a professional platform to attract potential clients and collaborators.

Comments: Comments were added before each element and block in the HTML and JavaScript files.

Required Attributes: The required attribute was added to all input fields in the form to ensure the user cannot submit the form without completing the required fields.

Landing Page: Added a landing page that displays a message after the form is submitted. It also generates and displays a random reference number using JavaScript. This page is initially hidden and shown upon form submission.

Responsive Layout: The layout scales better across different screen sizes, ensuring usability and aesthetics on various devices.

## UX/UI Design

### Project Goals
- Create a professional portfolio website to showcase development skills.
- Attract potential clients and collaborators.

### User Goals
- Easily navigate and find information about services and projects.
- Contact the developer for collaboration or inquiries.

### Parental Goals
- Ensure the website is safe and appropriate for all audiences.

### Developer and Business Goals
- Demonstrate expertise in full stack development.
- Highlight past projects and testimonials to build credibility.

## Colour Scheme
Created a color scheme for portfolio website involves choosing a palette that reflects your personal style while ensuring readability and aesthetic appeal.The three main colors used are Code Institute Blue, red, and white.

- ### Primary Color 

Hex Code: #1E3A8A
Color: Deep Blue
Usage: This color can be used for headers, navigation bar, and other primary elements like buttons and links. It gives a professional and modern look.

- ### Secondary Color 

Hex Code: #22D3EE
Color: Cyan
Usage: Ideal for highlighting important sections, secondary buttons, and icons. It pairs well with deep blue to create a dynamic contrast.

- ### Background Color 

Hex Code: #F9FAFB
Color: Light Gray
Usage: Use this as the main background color to ensure content readability and a clean, minimalist appearance.

- ### Accent Color 

Hex Code: #F59E0B
Color: Amber
Usage: Use this color for accents like hover states, call-to-action buttons, and other interactive elements to draw attention.

- ### Text Color 

Hex Code: #111827
Color: Charcoal Black
Usage: Use this color for primary text. It ensures high readability against the light gray background.

- ### Secondary Text Color 

Hex Code: #4B5563
Color: Cool Gray
Usage: Use this for secondary text, such as subtitles or descriptions, providing a softer contrast against the background.

- ### Border/Divider Color 

Hex Code: #D1D5DB
Color: Light Gray
Usage: For borders, dividers, and subtle lines, this color will maintain the minimalist feel without being too bold. 

## Typography
The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

## User Stories
1. As a potential client, I want to see examples of past work to evaluate the developer's skills.
2. As a visitor, I want to easily find contact information to get in touch with the developer.
3. As a user, I want a responsive and visually appealing website experience.

### Solved Bugs  
I wanted to bring to your attention an ongoing issue related to my GitHub account that is affecting the visibility of my P-1 project. Despite having made 20 commits (please find the enclosed screenshot), the page is still not accessible to tutors, mentors, or yourself. This is the same issue we encountered when I initially submitted the project.  

During a recent tutoring session with Sara, we discussed this problem, and she suggested that I work from a new GitHub profile. Consequently, I transitioned my work from my previous profile (param155) to a new one (Purohit1999). Unfortunately, this means that the commits made under my old profile are not reflected on my new one. Additionally, I primarily use VS Code for my development work due to the slow performance of Gitpod, which significantly impacts my efficiency.  

It appears that there might be a configuration issue with my student account on the Code Institute platform. My mentor also believes that this is the case, as the project remains inaccessible despite being public. I kindly request that you liaise with the appropriate team at Code Institute to resolve this matter, as I have invested a considerable amount of time in ensuring that my P-1 project is both attractive and responsive.   
![Image Alt]()      
- **Custom Modal Opacity Issue**: Fixed by adjusting CSS properties.
- **Footer Social Media Not Centered**: `justify-content: center;` applied.

### Unit Testing
- **JavaScript Functions**: Ensured all custom scripts work as expected.

### Further Testing
- **Usability Testing**: Conduct tests to ensure ease of navigation, especially for first-time visitors.
- **Performance Testing**: Ensure the webpage loads quickly across all devices, particularly mobile.
- **A/B Testing**: Experiment with different call-to-action placements, button colors, and hero section layouts to maximize engagement.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify that the website meets accessibility standards (e.g., contrast ratios, alt texts, etc.).

## GitPod and GitHub Deployment Issues Resolved  
Over the past three days, I have been diligently working on my first project, which is now complete and functioning perfectly in Visual Studio. However, when attempting to share my project with the online tutors for review, they are unable to access my GitHub profile. This issue is severely hampering my progress as I am unable to receive the necessary feedback and move forward to the JavaScript lessons.

Despite multiple attempts to resolve this issue, including extensive troubleshooting on SLACK and seeking help from the online tutors, the problem remains unresolved. I am now reaching out to you as my last resort, hoping for a swift resolution.

The main issues I am encountering are as follows:

**GitHub Profile Visibility**: My online tutors are unable to view my GitHub profile and the project repository, which is essential for them to review my work.

**GitPod Accessibility**: There seem to be issues with GitPod that are preventing my project from being accessed and reviewed online.

Given that I have already invested a considerable amount of time and effort into resolving these issues without success, I kindly request your immediate assistance in addressing and resolving these problems. It is crucial for me to submit my project promptly and continue with the coursework as scheduled.

Please let me know if you require any additional information or access details to diagnose and fix the issues. Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.
