## 🔍 Project Overview
This project is a dynamic and interactive credit card form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Credit Card Form is designed to provide users with a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for entering their credit card details. It features real-time updates on a card preview, interactive animations, input validation, and formatting to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.
### Required Attributes
Added required to each input field to ensure that the form cannot be submitted without filling in all the fields.
Example: <input type="text" id="card-number" placeholder="1234 1234 1234 1234" maxlength="19" required />  
### Form Action and Method:

Added action="/process_payment" and method="POST" to the form element.
This specifies that the form data will be sent to the /process_payment endpoint using the POST method when the form is submitted.
These modifications ensure that users must fill in all required fields before submitting the form, and the form will be processed through the specified action and method.  
### Card Number Formatting:

Updated cardNumberInput to format as four groups of four digits.
Validates that the card number is 16 digits long.  
### Card Back Issue:

Fixed the issue of the card not flipping by ensuring CVV is correctly displayed on the back of the card.  
### Input Validation:

Added validation for card number, card holder name, and expiry date.
Alerts users to enter valid values if they do not match the required formats.  
### OTP Functionality:

Set the OTP to a fixed six-digit number "123456".
Added validation for OTP input during form submission.  
### Landing Page:

Added a home button to return to the main form.
Resets the form and hides the landing page when the home button is clicked.

## 🖋️ Typography

The typography for the webpage has been carefully selected to ensure readability, clarity, and a modern aesthetic. The combination of font styles, sizes, and weights contributes to an organized and user-friendly experience, enhancing both usability and visual hierarchy.

### 🅰️ Primary Font:
- **Font Family**: `Poppins`, sans-serif
  - **Description**: The "Poppins" font is a modern and clean sans-serif typeface. It offers excellent readability across various screen sizes and devices while adding a sleek, professional feel to the design.
  - **Use Case**: This font is used consistently across headings, subheadings, and body text to create a cohesive look and maintain a streamlined design.

### 🔡 Font Weights:
- **Bold (700)**: 
  - **Use Case**: Employed for primary headings (h1, h2) and important emphasis areas like buttons, to grab the user's attention and create clear visual hierarchy.
- **Semi-bold (600)**: 
  - **Use Case**: Used for subheadings (h3, h4) and smaller section titles to differentiate content blocks without overwhelming the user.
- **Regular (400)**: 
  - **Use Case**: Standard body text and paragraphs use the regular weight to ensure maximum readability for long-form content, such as descriptions or instructions.

### 🖋️ Font Sizes:
- **Headings**: 
  - **H1**: Large and bold to capture the user's attention and mark important sections.
  - **H2**: Slightly smaller than H1 but still bold, used for section headers to maintain content flow.
  - **H3 and H4**: Used for sub-sections or smaller groupings of content, balancing prominence and readability.
  
- **Body Text**: 
  - Set at a comfortable size to ensure readability across various devices, with sufficient spacing to enhance the user experience for longer reading sessions.

### ✨ Text Styling:
- **Uppercase Letters**: Applied to certain headings and buttons to create emphasis and differentiate important interactive elements.
- **Letter Spacing**: Slightly increased for uppercase text and buttons to improve readability and provide a more polished appearance.
- **Line Height**: Generous line height is applied to body text to improve readability and make the content easier to scan, particularly on mobile devices.

### 🎯 Hierarchy and Readability:
The typography choices follow a clear hierarchy to guide the user’s attention from the most important sections (headings) to secondary information (body text). Consistent use of font sizes and weights helps create a seamless and intuitive reading experience, enhancing the overall usability of the webpage.

### 🌐 Web Safe Fonts:
In case the primary font (`Poppins`) fails to load, the webpage falls back to a web-safe sans-serif font, ensuring that the content remains legible and visually appealing across all platforms and browsers.

### 🛠 Font Integration:
- **Google Fonts**: The Poppins font is integrated via Google Fonts, ensuring fast and reliable delivery of the font files.
